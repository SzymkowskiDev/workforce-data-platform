## Task
Create three types of loggers: 
    1. general-purpose debugging logger
    2. profiling logger for perofrmance measurement and code analysis
    3. auditor that logs security-related events 


## Learning outcomes
[ ]     Customizing loggers
[ ]     Three use cases for loggers (debugging, profiling and auditing)
[ ]     Output logs to different sources (console, file and email)
[ ]     Code profiling and performance measurement 

## Challanges
[ ]     Log as much useful information as possible (time, line, logger name etc.)
[ ]     Make email notification for auditor logs e.g. on this date, person A tried accessing salary info
[ ]     Save auditor and profiler logs to JSON file for programmatic access
[ ]     In every try-except capture stack traces
